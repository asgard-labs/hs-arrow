A Simple log of things to do on hs-haskell

This file is written it org-mode format (See Emacs org-mode)

** TODO Build gobject-introspection bindings automatically

We need to be able to recreate the GI bindings when arrow c_glib changes.  This requires
haskell-gi which we don't need for building the project in general.

Use "stack script" to recreate bindings.  Entry point can either be a shell script or Makefile target.

** TODO Test data

Generate test data and write to arrow format.  To bootstrap this will be done in Python.

** TODO Tool to inspect schema

First step, make an executable which takes an arrow file and shows the schema.  This will be used for verification during development

** TODO Builder monad

** TODO Convert array to vector

Can we do this without copying?
